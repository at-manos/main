    <h1>Write-up</h1>
    <p>This is a visualization of the Daily Weather in the U.S., for the year of 2017. It was provided by the NOAA Daily
      Global Historical Climatology Network. For the visualization, I chose the variables: temperature
      (min,max,average), data points and weather stations (to visualize the sample size), and total snow. I thought that
      this covered most of the data that users would like to see, seeing as the other variables are much more complex.
    </p>
    <p>I implemented several interactions in this visualization. The first thing you will see is the query filtering
      sliders. This allows you to set a minimum on any combination of datapoints that I have chosen. This means that you
      can view states that have >50 data points and >50F temperature. Any combination will work to dynamically filter
      the visualization down. I also implemented a hover, so that you can see the data for that state on its own. Inside
      that hover, you can see more datapoints that were not included in the filter, such as wind speed. It will show,
      with the appropriate color, a scale from the minimum temperature to the maximum, so that you can get a sense of
      how hot it is generally, and how much it varies.</p>
    <p>My development process consisted of exploring the D3 website until I found a demo that was close to the idea that
      I had in my head (https://observablehq.com/@d3/non-contiguous-cartogram). After I found this, I went ahead an
      copied my lab 4-5 project. I replaced the javascript with the code from the D3 demo, and I got to work trying to
      use the weather data instead of the obesity data that was used in the demo. To do this, I used AI to figure out
      how it links together, and map both the datasets of the states and the weather by using the FIPS code. In man
      hours, this project took me probably about 5 or 6 hours in total. The most time was spent first on finding
      something to build off of, and then finding my feet getting it to work with the weather database. Making it look
      nice, with the CSS and the other aspects was also difficult, although I did use AI to make it easier on myself, as
      I struggle with the intracacies of the library and filtering the data using javascript, which I don't have much
      experience for.</p>
